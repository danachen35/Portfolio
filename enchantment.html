								  <h4>At-a-glance</h4>
								  <ul>
								    <li><b>Problem:</b> Lottery odds feel like pure luck; applicants want data-backed strategies.</li>
								    <li><b>Data:</b> 42K+ 2024 applications + 40+ years of daily weather to analyze zone, timing, group size.</li>

								<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-top: 3.5em;">Intro</h4>
								<p>The Enchantments, nestled in Washington State’s Alpine Lakes Wilderness, are among the most coveted backcountry hiking destinations in the Pacific Northwest. With pristine alpine lakes, jagged granite peaks, and fragile ecosystems, the area draws tens of thousands of hopeful hikers each year. To protect this landscape, access is controlled by a competitive permit lottery system. Applicants submit preferred zones, dates, and group sizes, but with overall success rates often below 10%, landing a permit can feel like a roll of the dice, especially for the ultra-popular Core Enchantment Zone, which sees success rates dip below 1%.
								<br />
								Everyone says the Enchantments lottery is just luck — but what if it isn’t? What if winning a permit is less about chance and more about knowing how to play the game?
								<br>
								This project sets out to explore exactly that. By analyzing 2024 lottery application data and historical weather patterns, I uncovered hidden trends in zone selection, group size, and timing that can shift the odds in your favor. From understanding when to apply to which days offer the best balance of solitude and sunshine, this data-driven approach helps turn guesswork into strategy and makes your shot at the Enchantments just a little more winnable.
								<br>
								Below is a map illustrating the five zones hikers can select when applying for a permit:
								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/enchant_map.png" alt="" style="width: 700px; height: 450px;"/></span>
								To uncover these trends, I analyzed over 42,000 applications from the 2024 Enchantments permit lottery, paired with over 40 years (1981–2024) of daily temperature and precipitation historical data. To balance recency with reliability, I focused primarily on the most recent 5-10 year window to evaluate seasonal patterns and hiking conditions.
								</p>


								<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Zone Popularity vs. Success Rates</h4>
								<p>Not all zones are created equal — especially when it comes to your chances.
								The Core Enchantment Zone may be the most in-demand zone in the wilderness permit system, but it's also the most competitive by far, with over 81,000 selections and a success rate below 1%. On the opposite end, the Eightmile/Caroline Zone often being overlooked, had fewer than 3,000 selections yet emerged with the highest success rate (11.8%).
								For applicants seeking to tilt the odds in their favor, understanding zone dynamics is crucial. Choosing less-trafficked zones like Stuart or Snow can significantly increase your chances, especially when prioritized in early choice ranks. Sometimes, the best strategy is to go where fewer others are looking.

								</p>


								<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Timing Insights</h4>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 0">Timing plays a crucial role in shaping your chances of winning the Enchantments lottery. To explore this, I first looked at application volume and success rates across different months and weekdays.
								The overview charts below reveal a distinct inverse relationship between popularity and success. August drew the highest volume with over 42,000 applications, but had one of the lowest success rates at just 1.19%. In contrast, May and October saw fewer applicants and correspondingly, higher success rates of 11.28% and 5.52%, respectively. A similar trend played out across weekdays: Friday received nearly 27,000 entries but had the lowest success rate of only 1.34%, while Sunday and Monday offered the highest odds of winning—around 3.5% and 3.09%, respectively.
								<!-- August, the peak of hiking season, receives the highest volume of applications with over 42,000 choice selections. However, popularity comes with competition. August also sees the lowest success rate at just 1.19%. July and September follow similar patterns of high demand paired with low odds. In contrast, May emerges as a hidden gem. Despite fewer applications, its success rate soars to 11.28%, the highest of any month. October also offers better than average odds, with a 5.52% success rate and significantly lighter application volume. 
								This trend holds true on the weekly level as well. Fridays attract the largest number of applicants for over 26,000, but also yield the lowest success rate at just 1.34%. Meanwhile, Sundays and Mondays offer better chances of success, with a rates of 3.5% and 3.09% respectively though they receive fewer entries. The data suggests that applicants who opt for less crowded time slots, both by month and weekday, can meaningfully boost their odds of securing a permit especially. -->
								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/enchant_MonthWeekday.png" alt="" /></span>
								<br>
								To go beyond the surface, I further broke down the trends by zone:
								<ul>
								<li>Core Enchantment Zone experienced extremely low success rates year-round, especially in July and August where odds dipped below 1%. </li>
								<li>Eightmile/Caroline Zone was a hidden gem, with the highest success rates—peaking at 34.38% in May and staying favorable across most months. </li>
								<li>On a weekly basis, Core Zone remained the least forgiving, while Eightmile/Caroline Zone again stood out on Sundays and Mondays (success rates around 18%). </li>
								</ul>
								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/enchant_zonemonth.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/enchant_zoneweek.png" alt="" /></span>
								</p>


								<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Group Size Analysis</h4>
								<p>When it comes to increasing your odds in the Enchantments lottery, group size plays a surprisingly decisive role, yet it's one of the most commonly overlooked factors. Solo applicants (group size = 1) saw the highest overall success rate at 5.51%, significantly outperforming all larger group sizes. In contrast, groups of 4–7 people, which made up the majority of entries, consistently hovered just under 2%, with group size 7 hitting the lowest odds at only 1.64%. This trend suggests a strong inverse relationship between group size and success likely due to the limited number of available permits per day, where accommodating larger groups becomes more difficult.
								<!-- While applicants often focus on dates and zones, group size quietly plays a major role in lottery outcomes. In 2024, the majority of applications were for groups of four, making it the most common party size by a wide margin. However, being part of the crowd comes at a cost: groups of four had a success rate of just 2.03%. In contrast, solo applicants had the highest success rate at 5.51%, despite making up the smallest portion of entries. This suggests that smaller groups—particularly groups of one or two—enjoy a distinct statistical advantage. As group size increases, the success rate drops consistently, with groups of seven and eight seeing success rates fall below 1.65%. This isn’t surprising when you consider how permits are allocated. Each additional group member increases the demand for limited daily quotas. In effect, applying with a larger group magnifies the odds against you—especially when combined with high-demand zones or weekends. -->
								<br>
								Digging deeper into zone-specific trends, the disparity becomes even more pronounced. For example, solo applicants targeting the Eightmile/Caroline Zone enjoyed an impressive 16.28% success rate, while larger groups applying for popular zones like the Core Enchantments saw their odds drop drastically—down to just 0.33% for groups of 7. Across nearly every zone, smaller groups consistently achieved higher success rates likely benefiting from greater flexibility in permit allocation and fewer logistical constraints on group sizes.

								</p>
								

								<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Weather Trends & Seasonality</h4>
								<p>When applying for a permit to the Enchantments, most applicants focus on beating the odds—but what if you could also optimize for good weather? By combining lottery data with historical climate trends, it’s possible to improve not just your chances of getting in, but also your experience once you're there.
								<br>
								To understand seasonal weather patterns, I first analyzed over 40 years of historical data (1981–2024). The results revealed a reliable window of favorable conditions typically between mid-July and late August—when temperatures are warmer and precipitation is minimal. This period tends to offer the best balance of dryness and comfort, making it a practical target for most applicants.
								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/enchant_weatherall.png" alt="" /></span>
								To explore this further, I zoomed in on more recent years (2019–2024), accounting for the growing impact of climate variability. While the general mid-summer trend still holds, the data reveals increasing week-to-week fluctuations, suggesting that some days within “peak season” now carry more risk of poor weather than in the past. I also explored a scenario where an applicant submits desired entries for days with average temperatures above 52°F and precipitation below 0.03 inches. This filter adds a strategic layer but also narrows flexibility, highlighting the tradeoff between ideal weather and broader availability.
								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/enchant_weatherFiltered.png" alt="" /></span>
								<!-- For example, if you’re aiming for the Core Zone on days with average temperatures above 52°F and rainfall below 0.03 inches, the data points to a narrow, high-reward window: late July through early September. These weeks historically offer the most favorable weather—warm, dry, and ideal for high-alpine hiking—but also coincide with peak application volume, making them highly competitive. Applicants who are more flexible might consider slightly earlier or later periods (such as early July or mid-September) where weather is still reasonable and competition slightly less intense. In this way, weather becomes more than just a post-permit concern—it’s a critical variable in building a smarter application strategy. -->
								</p>


								<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Best Selection Strategy</h4>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 0">To bring it all together, I built an interactive dashboard that lets applicants explore their optimal strategy based on personal preferences. By selecting a target zone and preferred group size, users can immediately see which months and weekdays historically offer better odds. For those who also value ideal hiking conditions, optional weather filters allow users to pinpoint past application dates that aligned with warmer, drier days. This tool transforms guesswork into informed decision making, helping applicants find the best fit entry dates based on what matters most to them.
								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/enchant_dashboard.png" alt="" /></span>
								
								What if getting into the Enchantments wasn’t just a game of luck? With lottery and weather data, there’s a smarter way to plan and win.
								<br>
								To maximize your chances:
								<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
								<li>🎯 Pick the right zone: Less competitive areas like Eightmile/Caroline and Snow Zone offer higher acceptance rates. </li>
								<li>🗓️ Submit for midweek dates: Mondays and Tuesdays show significantly better success rates than weekends. </li>
								<li>👥 Keep your group size small: Solo or 2-person entries consistently outperform larger groups. </li>
								</ul>
								Optional considerations for weather-conscious applicants:
								<ul>
								<li>🌤️ Use weather filters cautiously: Applying thresholds (e.g., temp > 52°F and rain < 0.03”) may limit available date options—consider the tradeoff between ideal weather and permit availability. </li>
								</ul>
